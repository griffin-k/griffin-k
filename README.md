## About me
👋 Hello! I'm Karimullah, a passionate 3rd-year BSCS student at Lahore Garrison University. 💻 I wear multiple hats as an Android developer, skilled in crafting native mobile apps, and a web developer, specializing in React to build dynamic web experiences. 🌐 Recently, I've dived into Python and Django, adding versatile tools to my toolkit. Currently, I'm exploring the fascinating world of neural networks, reinforcement learning, robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

🛡️ My journey also ventures into the exciting realm of cybersecurity. As an ethical hacker, I've developed software for Android hacking and system hacking. I've also contributed to creating a safer digital environment by developing a Library Management Solution for Lahore Garrison University and a smart assistant called Luna, akin to Tony Stark's Jarvis. Additionally, I've created an AI-based gym trainer and much more. All my code is open source, so feel free to use it!

🚀 Join me on this coding journey, exploring new technologies, creating innovative solutions, and making the digital world more secure.
