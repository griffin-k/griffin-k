## About Me
👋 Hi there! I'm Karimullah, a passionate 3rd-year BSCS student at Lahore Garrison University. With a deep-seated love for technology, I specialize in crafting sleek native mobile apps using Kotlin and Java, and dynamic web experiences with React and Django. My curiosity extends beyond traditional software development into the fascinating world of embedded systems, particularly in UAV technology, where I'm constantly exploring new horizons. Additionally, I'm an ethical hacker dedicated to creating a safer digital landscape, and I'm always excited to delve into the realms of neural networks, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Let's connect and explore the possibilities together! 🚀
